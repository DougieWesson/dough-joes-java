## Dough Joe's Pizza - Java Edition

Create a Java application that allows the creation of pizzas of different types.

 - A pizza consists of a base and up to 4 toppings.
 - There are 3 different types of pizza:
   - Customisable - can add any base or toppings
   - Healthy - can only add "healthy" toppings and can only be thin crust
   - Deluxe - is a fixed type of pizza with specific toppings and base of your choosing, cannot be customised.
 - Toppings can be single or double.
 - Pizzas can be small, medium and large.
 - Think of at least 3 different base types.
 - It should be possible to find out the cost of a pizza based on its base type, size and toppings.
 - Once created I can add my pizzas to and order.
 - Orders should be able to give the total amount of all pizzas in the order.
